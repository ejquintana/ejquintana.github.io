				I love chocolate cake.
			And when I was a boy
			I loved it even more.
		</p>
		<p id="p2">
			Sometimes we used to have it for tea
			and Mum used to say,
			'If there's any left over
			you can have it to take to school
			tomorrow to have at playtime.'
			And the next day I would take it to school
			wrapped up in tin foil
			open it up at playtime
			and sit in the corner of the playground
			eating it,
			you know how the icing on top
			is all shiny and it cracks as you
			bite into it,
			and there's that other kind of icing in
			the middle
			and it sticks to your hands and you
			can lick your fingers
			and lick your lips
			oh it's lovely.
			yeah.
